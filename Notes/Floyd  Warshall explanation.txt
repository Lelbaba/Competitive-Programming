assume that the a path between A to E is
A -> B -> C -> D -> E
so, B-> C-> D is the path
you can relax them in any order as you want but the path remains same
suppose you relax B first, then it will become A -> C -> D -> E
after relaxing D, the path will become A-> C-> E
after C, A-> E
we can see that any order of {B,C,D} will still yield this result

It should be able to solve any problem that can be solved associatively with DP

Cycle:
let 
a-> b-> c-> d-> a be a cycle 
as b,c,d will be relaxed once exactly, the path will also be considered once

Negative Weight:
it will work with negative weights as wll
and negative cycles can be detected by checking the main diagonal
