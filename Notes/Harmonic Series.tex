\begin{lstlisting}
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
	for(int j = i; j < n; j+= i)
		// some O(1) task
\end{lstlisting}

What is the time complexity of this code? This can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
T(n) = \sum_{i = 0}^{n} \frac{n}{i}  \approx nlog(n)
\end{equation}

This comes useful in some problems, often in divisor related problems. Seive of eratosthenes uses this fact as well.
