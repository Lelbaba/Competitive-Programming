\subsection*{Solution Bags}
DP problems may often require some form of optimization that requires a data structure. A bag is the simplest possible data structure, which inserts an elements, and pops some arbitrary element from the bag.  
\begin{itemize}
	\item Often involves iteration and insertion along with a simple way to get optimal answer
	\item Make some observation, impose some limitations on the structure
	\item find a more suitable DS to replace the bag with, which will allow fast answer of certain queries.
	\item For certain data structure, deltaing or array compression might be necessary
\end{itemize}
