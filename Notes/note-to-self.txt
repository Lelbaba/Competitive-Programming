- Read Question Properly, don't rush, don't assume baselessly
- Check each constraint
- Break down the problem in simple terms

- If it looks like a greedy problem
	1. Can you binary search the inverse problem?
	2. Can you use two pointers?
	3. Is a bruteforce DP solution forced to make this greedy choice?
	4. if things aren't working, try to solve it from the opposite perspective.

- If you are stuck, take  break for 5 mins, dont think. Drink water, go to the washroom
- It's okay if you stay stuck, not the end of the world.

- Array out of bound, overflow, undefined behaviours.
- check the function parameters

- plan out an implementation before you start coding at all, analyze complexity carefully

- bitsets?
- to debug, read your code bottom up
- dont try iterative dp, just dont.
