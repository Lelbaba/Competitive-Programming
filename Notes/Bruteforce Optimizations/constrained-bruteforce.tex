\subsection{Constrained Bruteforce}
Sometimes a seemingly impossible problem (due to timelimit) with higher time complexity can be solved by slightly changing a bruteforce solution. This comes down to observing some unusual constraints (often involving pigeonhole principle) in the problem that allows a tuned bruteforce to pass.
