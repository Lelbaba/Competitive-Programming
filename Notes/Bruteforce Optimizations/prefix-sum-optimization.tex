\subsection{Prefix Sum Optimization}
Bruteforce solutions are often optimized by using dynamic programming or data structures. Prefix sum optimization of DP is an example of both working together. When the subproblems of a state involves a range of states, then the ranges can be calculated fast using a prefix sum DP.
