\subsection*{Counting}
Counting problems most often involve finding combinations and permutations, sometimes demanding the answers be printed modulo some large prime. Usually they are very observation dependant. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Be careful of overlapping cases, ordering or fixing some elements might be effective
	\item Try changing the POV (Counting in two ways ?)
	\item Dynamic Programming
	\item Bitmasking ?
	\item Maybe there is some property that allows it to be bruteforcable ?
\end{itemize}
